        In the case of data stored in log files, these data will be erased after 7

      <!-- <h4>2.1.2 Google Analytics</h4> -->
      <!-- <p>
        On our website we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google
        Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland("Google"). <br>
        Google Analytics uses cookies and creates pseudonymised usage profiles.
        The information created by the cookie regarding your use of our website
        (type and version of browser, operating system, referrer URL, IP address
        and time of the server request) will usually be transferred to a server of
        Google in the USA and will be stored there. Prior to that, your IP address
        will be shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union
        or other countries which are contracting parties to the Agreement on the
        European Economic Area and will be anonymized in a way that it can no longer
        be attributed to you (IP anonymization). The IP address will not be combined
        with other data of Google. On our behalf Google will use the information
        collected in order to analyze your use of our website, to compile reports
        on your website activities, and to provide further services in connection
        with the use of our website and the Internet. <br>
        Google is certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement and thus
        guarantees to comply with European data protection law. Information on the
        EU-U.S. Privacy Shield agreement can be found under the following link:

        The personal data will be erased or anonymized after 14 months. <br>
        Insofar as personal data are concerned and we pass on data to third parties,
        the legal basis for the data processing is your consent (Article 6 para. 
        1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR). In addition, we base the data processing on our
        overriding legitimate interests (Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR)
        in the operation, analysis, and optimization of our website.  <br>
        You can prevent the storage of cookies by rejecting the cookie banner and
        by using an appropriate setting of your browser software. However, we would
        like to point out that in this case you may possibly not be able to fully
        use all the functions of our online presence. Furthermore, you can prevent
        the collection and processing by Google of the data generated by the cookie

      <h3>2.2 Communication via Email or Other Channels</h3>
      <p>
        If you communicate with us by using a email or other channel,
        we process your personal data to handle your request. These data include e.g.:
      </p>
      <ul class="mx-4">
        <li>contact details, e.g. name, email address, postal address, phone number (if provided), as well as</li>
        <li>content data of the communication.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The legal basis for processing the data is Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b
        GDPR. According to this provision, we are allowed to process data wherever
        the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you
        are a party or in order to take steps prior to entering into a contract.
        Besides, we base the data processing on our overriding legitimate interests
        (Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR). <br>
        Please note that, in general, data is not always transmitted securely on
        the Internet. Especially in email traffic the protection of data cannot
        be guaranteed during the exchange of data. We recommend that you do not
        send any particularly sensitive data to us by email.
      </p>

      <h3>2.3 Other Communication with (Potential) Contracting Parties</h3>
      <p>
        n case you – as a customer, service provider, or other contracting party
        – seek to enter into a contractual relationship with us, or already have
        entered into a such a relationship, we process data necessary for the
        performance of the contract like
      </p>
      <ul class="mx-4">
        <li>basic data, e.g. name, address, subject matter and duration of the contract, etc.; as well as</li>
        <li>payment information, e.g. bank details, payment history.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The legal basis for data processing is Article 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b
        GDPR. According to this provision, we are allowed to process data insofar
        as the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
        you are a party or if the processing is necessary for the implementation
        of pre-contractual measures. <br>
        DThe data will be deleted as soon as their processing is no longer necessary.
        This means that the data will be erased once the contractual relationship
        has ended, potential warranty claims have expired, and we are no longer
        obligated by legal record-keeping requirements to store the data beyond
        this point. Such record-keeping requirements could arise e.g. from the
        relevant legal provisions in German commercial and fiscal law, namely
        sections 238 et seq. and 257 of the German Commercial Code and section 147
        of the Fiscal Code of Germany.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Use of our Online Presences on Social Platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn or GithHub)</h3>
      <p>
        We maintain online presences on several social platforms in order to communicate
        with the users who are active on these platforms. At present, we maintain
        online presences Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub.
      </p>
      <h4>2.4.1 Processing of Data by Social Platforms </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>We would like to point out that you use the social platforms solely
          on your own responsibility.</strong> The use of the social platforms is
          not necessary for contacting us. You can also communicate with us using

        <strong>We have no influence on the data processed by the social platforms
          and on the scope of this data processing.</strong> This applies in particular
          to the use of interactive functions (e.g. sending, sharing or rating of
          messages). The following information can be found hereafter: information
          on who is responsible for the social media used by us; information regarding
          the purposes for which – according to their own statements – the social
          platforms process data; information about the safeguards which justify a

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When using social platforms, your personal data will be collected, transferred,
        stored, disclosed, and used by those responsible. Regardless of your place
        of residence, your data will thereby be transferred to and used in the
        United States and any other country where the social platform does business.
        <strong>The providers of the social platforms are non-European companies
          which at most consider themselves to be bound by European data protection
          provisions to a limited extent only.</strong> This can for example have
          an impact on the rights granted to you by the GDPR as a data subject. <br>
          As a general rule, the social platforms process the following data:
      </p>
      <ul class="mx-4">
        <li>
          data you have voluntarily entered, e.g. name, login data, contact data,
          and potentially data regarding contacts from your address book (insofar
          as you upload or synchronize your address book);
        </li>
        <li>
          data which can be derived from the contents shared by you (e.g. interest
          in specific topics);
        </li>
        <li>
          data which can be derived from your communication with third parties or
          from the circumstances of your communication, e.g. contents of confidential
          messages, information related to your location, information regarding wireless
          networks, etc.;
        </li>
        <li>
          data which is created when you view content (also without having created
          an account), e.g. IP address, type of browser, operating system, information
          about the website you have visited before, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, the social platforms may possibly use analysis tools and
        cookies for the analysis for your data. Insofar as analysis tools and cookies
        are being used, we have not commissioned their use nor have we supported
        it in any other way. Insofar as personal data are being analyzed, these
        data are not made available to us. Only non-personal information (e.g.
        regarding tweet activities) are accessible to us.<br>
        You have the possibility to limit the processing of your data. To do so,
        please use the general settings of your accounts on the social platforms
        (e.g. under the section "Data Protection and Safety"). In case of access
        by mobile device, please use your mobile device’s settings (e.g. limiting
        the access options to contact data and calendar data). <br>
      </p>
      <h4>2.4.2 Processing of Data by Us</h4>
      <p>
        We also process your personal data when you use the social platforms. We
        do not collect any of your personal data through our accounts. However,
        the data entered by you (e.g. user name, posts) will potentially be used
        by us to reply to you or to share (retweet) your posting. In this way,
        the data disclosed by you will be made accessible to our followers. <br>
        To this data processing, the principles described in section 2.2 of this
        privacy statement apply accordingly.
      </p>

      <h3>2.5 No Legal or Contractual Obligation to Provide Your Personal Data</h3>
      <p>
        There is no legal obligation for you to provide your personal data to us.
        This means that you are not required to provide your personal data to us.
        If, however, you do not provide your personal data to us, this could
        potentially result in our potential inability to communicate with you,
        to enter into a contract with you or to perform a contract.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Transfer of Your Personal Data to Recipients</h2>
      <p>
        Generally, a transfer of your data does not occur unless explicitly stated
        in section 2 of this privacy statement. As far as data are transferred
        during the processing procedures mentioned in section 2 to the servers
        of providers commissioned by us with providing tracking or targeting
        technologies or are transferred to the servers of providers of social
        platforms in the United States, this data transfer takes place according
        to the principles of the so-called "EU‑U.S. Privacy Shield". For more
        information on the EU-U.S: Privacy shield, please follow the hyperlinks
        in section 2.4.1 of this privacy statement.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Your Rights (Including Your Right to Object)</h2>
      <p>
        According to applicable data protection laws you have the following rights:
      </p>
      <ul class="mx-4">
        <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation
          as to whether or not personal data concerning you are being processed by
          us. Where that is the case, you have the right to obtain access to these
          personal data and further information concerning their processing (Article 
          15 GDPR). Please note that in certain cases this right may be restricted
          or excluded.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> In case personal data concerning
          you are not (any longer) accurate or are incomplete, you can demand

          data (Article 16 GDPR).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure and right to restriction of processing:</strong>
          If legal requirements are met, you can demand erasure of your personal
          data (Article 17 GDPR) or restriction of the processing of these data
          (Article 18 GDPR), e.g. if the processing of these data is no longer
          necessary in relation to the purposes for which these data were collected
          by us.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Right to be notified:</strong> If you have asserted your right
          to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing against us, we
          are obligated to communicate this rectification, erasure or restriction
          of processing of your personal data to each recipient to whom these data
          have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves a
          disproportionate effort. You have the right to request information about
          these recipients from us.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> Under certain conditions,
          you have the right to receive personal data concerning you, which you
          have provided to us, in a specific format or to transmit those data to
          another controller (Article 20 GDPR).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</strong>
          You can lodge a complaint against the processing of your personal data
          by us with a data protection authority, in particular in the EU member
          state of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged
          infringement of applicable data protection laws (Article 77 GDPR). <br>
