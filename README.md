## VarsAndNumbers.com -- My Website

This is the repository I use for the development of my professional [website](https://varsandnumbers.com/).

I have implemented a static website and a blog using the Jekyll framework. The website is fully responsive with the help of Bootstrap. Other than that, I have used the CSS-preprocessor Sass, a bit of jQuery here and there, and a few cool JavaScript packages. The design, the images and the video were all done "by ourselves", by which I mean with a lot of help, hints and feedback from my awesome wife.

Should you be interested in my implementation, feel free to comment it, copy it or use it as a reference. I have "gitignored" some very few private bits of code. But nevertheless, the code as is in this repository still makes for a fully functioning website.
