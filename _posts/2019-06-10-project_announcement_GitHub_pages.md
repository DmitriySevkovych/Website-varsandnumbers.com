Hello everybody!

Since my *Vars&Numbers*-website is practically done and dusted, I have been thinking
about what fun thing to do next. A lot of glorious-though-kinda-vague ideas came
and went, and some may still be maturing somewhere deep in my mind. But today I
would like to announce and explain a fairly simple idea for a project that I will
implement together with my wife, Ivanna.

We have decided to build another static website together and host it on GitHub.
Sounds boring? It might be boring for some of you, but it also might be not, so
read on.

Our main motivation for this project are the awesome parallax techniques demonstrated
by [Travis Neilson](http://travisneilson.com/) on his *DevTips* channel. We will
try to utilize some of his hints and tricks to create an interactive story
about us, our work and our hobbies.

Ivanna is a professional 3D artist and designer, and I usually pay my dues by coding
stuff. But for this project we will switch roles: I am the designer, and she does
the code. I think this will be great fun! And even more so because Ivanna has no
programming experience whatsoever. In the meantime I, the designer, would be
a fool not to admit her superiority when it comes to making things look good.

To round things up, here is a sort of technological road map for this project:
We will use the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) framework to build a static website,
and use the free hosting opportunity on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Our goal is the development of a desktop-first website, but we will use some
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to make it neat and responsive. I am quite
sure that we will introduce [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and probably some other
cool JavaScript libraries along the way. On the backend-side we have a tiny bit
of project management with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/),
and that's pretty much it. In fact, I have already set-up an empty project, which
you can check out [here](https://github.com/DmitriySevkovych/DmitriySevkovych.github.io).

Why am I writing all that? Well, for us this project is all about sharing with
and learning from each other. Maybe some of you might want to join the party and
learn something from us. Or teach us something. We won't say no. I imagine that
we will go at not too fast a pace, since this is a leisure project, but this might
be a good thing for you to follow along. Obviously the code will be pushed to
GitHub, but if there should be anything you wish to tell us just hit the "Discuss"
button below and let us know.
