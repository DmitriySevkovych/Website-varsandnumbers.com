Today is a remarkable day, don't you think? I do think so, and here is why:

I am happy and excited to announce that today is the birthday of *Vars&Numbers:
Software Development & Mathematics*.

What is Vars&Numbers? It has something to do with software development and mathematics,
obviously. Actually, Vars&Numbers is the nickname (a registered trademark to
be precise) under which from this day on I will offer my services as a freelancer.
With other words, Vars&Numbers is simply me, and I am Vars&Numbers.
