Hi everybody,

since the major portion of my time for the last half a year has been spent on backend/service development in a bigger project, I haven't been active on this little blog of mine. To make things up, I am very happy to say that I have found a few hours to commit to creating a new website for the [Gelateria Ice Ice Baby](https://icebaby.de).

Gelateria Ice Ice Baby are a newly founded ice cream artisans located in Stuttgart Bad-Cannstatt, only a few tram stations from where I live. The guys are trying hard to bring ice cream in Stuttgart to a whole new level, successfully experimenting with renowned and world-valued ingredients such as Persian saffron, Turkish hazelnut and Indian mango. They don't stop at serving the oldschool vanilla or strawberry ice cream, but treat you with some special goodies such as bubble waffles and protein ice cream. Be aware though that their menu is constantly changing, which in my opinion is a great thing. But if you are on the lookout for a very specific sort of ice cream, it might be a good idea to ask in advance whether they have it at the moment.

But enough talking, [have a look](https://icebaby.de) for yourselves, and if you are into sweets, [pay the guys a visit](https://icebaby.de/#visit-us). And hey, although it is February, it is never too cold to have some quality ice cream and coffee! Or bubble waffles and coffee, whichever you prefer.

Last but not least, if you want to have a chat about this little project or discuss your own projects with me, hit the "Discuss" button below and send me a mail. As always, any feedback is appreciated.
