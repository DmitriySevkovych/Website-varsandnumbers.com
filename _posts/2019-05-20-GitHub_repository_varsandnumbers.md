Hello all! I have published the code for this website on GitHub.

I have been developing for a few months now, but I have been doing so locally.
Now the time has come to publish my code on GitHub. If you are interested in my
implementation, you can take a look at the [repository](https://github.com/DmitriySevkovych/Website-varsandnumbers.com)
of this project, it is public. At the moment it's the only public repository that
I contribute to, and the only repository that belongs to me for that matter. But
I plan to change this sooner rather than later. All of my open source projects will
be announced here.
