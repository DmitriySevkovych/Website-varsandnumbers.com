      Do you have a problem, but struggle to find a satisfying solution?
    </li>
    <li class="faded">
      Or on the contrary: the gamechanger idea is in your head, but you need
     advice to make it kick into gear?
    </li>
    <li class="fading">
      In any case, wouldn't it be helpful to have another capable person get their
      hands dirty and (pitch in on) contribute to your project?
    </li>
    <li class="focused">
      What if you don't want to have to deal with the matter at all? How about
      just getting the finished product? Oh, and long-time support would be great!
    </li>
    <li class="fading">
      You search for a person who can think around the corner and does not get
      lost in the complexity?
    </li>
    <li class="yet-to-show">
      Need to present your product to picky customers? You want it to look neat or
      extra-user-friendly or fancy or ... in short, a good design is a must?
    </li>
    <li class="yet-to-show">
      Or you simply search for somebody who has sound knowledge of mathematics,
      software, DevOps or digital design?
    </li>
  </ul>

  here is an overview of <a href="legal.html">services and prices in plain terms</a>.
