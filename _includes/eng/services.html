    Dear guest...
  </div>

  <div class="get-attention">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Do you have a problem, but struggle to find a satisfying solution?
      </li>
      <li>
        Or on the contrary: the gamechanger idea is in your head, but you need
       advice to make it kick into gear?
      </li>
      <li>
        In any case, wouldn't it be helpful to have another capable person get their
        hands dirty and (pitch in on) contribute to your project?
      </li>
      <li>
        What if you don't want to have to deal with the matter at all? How about
        just getting the finished product? Oh, and long-time support would be great!
      </li>
      <li>
        You search for a person who can think around the corner and does not get
        lost in the complexity?
      </li>
      <li>
        Need to present your product to picky customers? You want it to look neat or
        extra-user-friendly or fancy or ... in short, a good design is a must?
      </li>
      <li>
        Or you simply search for somebody who has sound knowledge of mathematics,
        software, DevOps or digital design?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="round-up">
