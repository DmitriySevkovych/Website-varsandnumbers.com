          Dear guest! Does your enterprise have a problem, but you struggle to find
          a satisfying solution?
        </div>
        <div>
          Or on the contrary: the gamechanger idea is in your head, but you need
          a little advice to make it kick into gear?
        </div>
        <div>
          In any case, wouldn't it be helpful to have another capable person get their
          hands dirty and contribute to your project?
        </div>
        <div>
          What if you don't want to have to deal with the matter at all? How about
          just getting the finished product? Oh, and long-time support would be great!
        </div>
        <div>
          You search for a person who can think around the corner and doesn't get
          lost in the complexity?
        </div>
        <div>
          Need to present your product to picky customers? You want it to look neat or
          extra-user-friendly or fancy or ... in short, a good design is a must?
        </div>
        <div>
          Or you simply search for somebody who has sound knowledge of mathematics,
          software, DevOps or digital design?
        </div>
        <div>
          Keep on going! Almost done!

      In case you find yourself in any of these situations: <br>
      How about giving me a go at it? Of course I offer all of the services that are alluded to, but let's put the allusions aside.
      Here is an overview of my services in plain terms:
    </p>
    <div class="services-plain-terms">
      <p>Concept development</p>

      <p>Implementation</p>
      <p>Long-time support</p>
    </div>

      This being said, I would strongly encourage you to find out more about <a href="expertise.html">what I do</a> and <a href="about_me.html">who I am</a>.
